# Maybe-Useful-Cogs
A few cogs for [Twentysix's Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).
To add, do `[p]cog repo add stevy https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs/`

**Why...** 

Because I wanted to make them.

**Do you suck?** 

Oh.

**Support** 

If you would like some support for these cogs because nothing ever works, you can talk to me in my testing/spam server, [bot testing](https://discord.gg/T5HHf7k). I don't bite, I promise :3

__Leveler Support__ - `pip3 install scipy` is known to not work on Windows (Linux should work fine). Scipy is NOT required, but needed for auto color generation. I personally would recommend downloading it because having the auto command is the difference between http://puu.sh/qL7gy/de2d4c61c0.jpg and http://puu.sh/qL7hK/d94cad0936.jpg. I think you can tell the difference.

1) Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows and download your version (32/64-bit) of Anaconda. This is a pretty large download, fair warning. Additionally, make sure you **ADD TO PATH**. This will install `scipy`. **IF** you can no longer start your bot because discord.py is no longer found, it's because python3.5 has been reinstalled. If this is the case, **open cmd**, do `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@master#egg=discord.py[voice]` as it should already know it's python3.5. Install pillow using `pip install pillow`. Then, install any other dependencies you have in the same fashion (`pip install`) for your other cogs. Everything should work afterwards.

2) Google! It's your friend!

3) Come to the [support server](https://discord.gg/T5HHf7k) to complain or just to hang out c:
