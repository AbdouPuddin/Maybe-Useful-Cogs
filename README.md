# Maybe-Useful-Cogs
A few cogs for [Twentysix's Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).
To add, do `[p]cog repo add stevy https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs/`

**Why...** 

Because I wanted to make them.

**Do you suck?** 

Oh.

**Support** 

If you would like some support for these cogs because nothing ever works, you can talk to me in my testing/spam server, [bot testing](https://discord.gg/T5HHf7k). I don't bite, I promise :3
