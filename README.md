# Maybe-Useful-Cogs
So far, only an osu! cog for [Twentysix's Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).

**Why...** 

Because I wanted to make an osu! cog since there wasn't one.

**Do you suck?** 

Oh.

**Support** 

If you would like some support for these cogs because nothing ever works, you can talk to me in my testing/spam server, [bot testting](https://discord.gg/T5HHf7k). I don't bite, I promise :3
